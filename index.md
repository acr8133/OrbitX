Kerbal Operating System **(kOS)** scripts for Tundra Exploration rockets. 
The script is capable of bringing payload into target orbit and target inclination. 
It also has the capability of landing Ghidorah 9's first stage and side boosters into the target coordinates.

# Disclaimer:
- The script is tested and balanced to work on 2.5x rescale system.
- ASDS profile works best in equatorial launches.

# Known Bugs:
- Circulation maneuver execution causes the second stage overstreer.
- Script broken when using full expend mode on Heavy variant.
- NOGUI missing variables.

# Planned:
- Yet another ASDS landing rework
	- third rework will be made to increase landing success chance in inclined launches
	- this is also a preparation for the Gojira rocket
- Gojira ( Starship and Superheavy )
