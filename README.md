 # Ghidorah 9
 Kerbal Operating System **(kOS)** scripts that's currently being used on 
 Tundra Exploration's Ghidorah launch system. The script is capable of bringing payload
 into target orbit and target inclination. It also has the capability of
 landing Ghidorah 9's first stage boosters into the target coordinates.
  **Current Version: V0.7.3**

 # Usage:
 - **Boot Scripts**
	- Put the **AscentScript.ks** at the second stage and **RecoveryScript.ks** at the
	first stage of the rocket.
 - **Mission Parameters**
	- Found inside the **missionParameters.ks** are some variables you can set to tune
	the rocket for your own missions. You can refer to the instructions inside the
	**missionParameters.ks** for tuning the script to your own KSP missions. Set a target
	at the first line of the file. It will override the current target inclination.
